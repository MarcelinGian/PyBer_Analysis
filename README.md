# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:
##### The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Python and Pandas. Then to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib.

### Results:
##### The data show that there are significant differences in ride sharing based on geography. areas designated as Urban have the by far the most Pyber drivers as well as rides. Over 60% of Pyber revenue, as measured by Total Fares, is generated by Urban Drivers. These Urban driverss, hovever, earn the smallest fares per ride on average when compared to their Suburban & Rural counterparts. Drivers in Rural areas earn by far the higest fares of the three geographical areas, their average is $55.49 which is over 3 times that of their Urban counterparts. At $34.62, Average Fare per Ride is also highest in Rural areas.

### Recommendations Summary
##### With the  Rural drivers $55.49 per fare on average, PyBer may seek to emphasize this earning potential to prospective drivers in Rural areas to add to their Rural fleet. With only 78 drivers in Rural areas, it's very low at the moment. There's also room for growth in the Suburban market, the Suberban driving fleet is 1/5 the size of their Urban counterparts but still manages to bring in about half the Urban driver's Total Fares. There seems to be a good deal of room for growth in the Driver side as well as the customer side in the Suburban market.
